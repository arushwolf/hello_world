#update

Hi everyone!! It has been a while since I was last here. Of course, I have not been just sitting around.
Recently, I added Python, C++, and some Arduino to my portfolio of languages.
I will try to be more active on my page and add my projects that I will work on in the future.
That's it for the update, thank you for reading!!
